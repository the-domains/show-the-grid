description: "It's still considered unusual to attend a movie screening dressed as one of its characters. Diehard fans of Star Wars: The Force Awakens turned up in force for the movie's premiere, but normally there are only two exceptions for rocking a costume to the movie theater: children under the age of eight, and Ronda Rousey."
